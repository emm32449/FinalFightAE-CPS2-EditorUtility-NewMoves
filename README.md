# FinalFightAE-CPS2-EditorUtility-NewMoves
An inspired development project for Final Fight AE on CPS2.   1) A basic utility that works seamlessly with the existing Final Fight AE CPS2 Editor JSON.  2) A proposal for innovative combat routines called ‘Instinct Combos’, enhancing the game’s combat system. It also includes proposing new moves, offering more variety and strategy for players.

## Basic Utility

We are developing basic utility components that work with the existing Final Fight AE CPS2 Editor JSON. These functions are designed to improve the related mod development and simplify certain use cases. 

## Instinct Combos

The increased modding potential for this game was unlocked with source code derivation, opening up new possibilities for game modification and enhancement. We are excited to propose a new feature for the game's combat system - 'Instinct Combos'. This innovative combat routine will add a new layer of strategy and variety to the game, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

Instinct Combos will allow players to execute a series of moves in quick succession, providing them with more options during combat while using specific minimal input. We believe this feature will make the combat system more dynamic and engaging for large enemy groups.
